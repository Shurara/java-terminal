This is a Java terminal emulator. It uses Swing, so it should run on all platforms. For a usage demo, see the DemoConsole class.

*Using the terminal:*

Type text into the prompt like any other terminal. Use the arrow keys to move within the current line, and the backspace key to delete text. You can copy/paste text into the terminal.
Press tab for autocomplete. You cannot edit previously entered lines or text output by the console (i.e. a prompt).
